This is a set of patches to amber SVN to make it work here. 

Patches by name

testbench.patch
---------------

This patch puts clk_count into the a23_decompile.v so that this gets incremented without having to have it at the toplevel testbench. 
It also removes the `TB.clk_count stuff and just uses clk_count. The native Amber testbench stuff is a bit annoying IMHO. 

buslower.patch
--------------

This patch gives us the lower two bits of the address bus which parts of the archimedes MEMC needs but are missing from Amber. 

translate.patch
---------------

Adds decode logic for an ARM translate pin on Amber. This is implemented as the wb_tga signal. 

data_dabt.patch
---------------

Adds data abort to the core. Not perfect but enough to run RISC OS 1/2/3.


decodelogic.patch
-----------------

Fixes all the broken carry logic.
